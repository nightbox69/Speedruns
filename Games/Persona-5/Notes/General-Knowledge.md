# General Knowledge

This is meant to be a catch all of general knowledge that can be applied to most of the Hard True Ending PC routes.

## About the Notes

The notes in this repository are [based][1] from a combination of Cereth's Beginner and Advanced Guides, [Asa1108's Notes][2] and some advancements discussed by fellow runners in the discord. Any breaks listed in square brackets (e.g. 1:00) require turbo on confirm and FFWD on at 120fps and are rough estimates at best.

 - Class questions are only correct for the early game. When the answer is no longer listed, mash the top option
 - When learning new skills, if it is not listed, you don't need to learn it. (90% Yusuke's Skills are this. You can learn Morgana's Healing Skills tho.)
 - When learning the run, it is expected that you watch a video of a run of a palace before doing it. You will need to practice OoB skips.
 - Required social stats - **Knowledge 4, Charm 3, Kindness 4**
 - Speedrun Required Confidant Skills: **Chariot 4 (Stealth Dash), Hermit 2 (Mementos Scan), Moon 3 (Exp), Death 1 (Kamoshida Items), Justice 10**
 - Plot Required Confidant Levels: Councillor 10, Justice 10, Fool 10, Magician 10, Judgement 10
 - There are some parts of the notes especially in the mid-latter parts that during the evenings you will need to sleep. That simply means there are people in the cafe and it has been proven that holding Triangle (or Y) while interacting with them will speed up the textboxes making kicking them out of the shop + studying faster than sleeping.
 - Don't bother training your proficiency. Just buy that thing in Akihabara after Sae's Palace or ABC's of Crafting in the Shibuya Bookstore if you really need it.

## Pre-Start Menu Settings

  * Maintain Fast-Forward ON
  * Cursor Memory ON (Preference but recommended)
  * Battle Memory ON (Preference but recommended)
  * Persona Memory OFF
  * Camera Speed High or Max  

## Avoiding Fights

Always do this at all costs unless specified!!!! Experience is very tight in this run. One extra kill in the late game can mean the difference between Ann and Ryuji gaining a level before a certain fight in the 3rd term. Otherwise the additional experience will cause you to learn skills in inopportune moments where you will need the skill you will delete for the next fight. Overall, don't kill the shadows, down them with their weakness and run away. The Notes has all shadow weaknesses until Futaba. After Futaba you're just expected to either avoid the fight entirely with either a Smokescreen or a Hypno Mist as Joker will have access to Repel Physical that will kill a Shadow if they attack Joker.

## Money
You will need to have 214462 Yen before the Shido Boss Fight. This is doable by selling two Soma's (100k), Homonculus (20k, if not used in the Oberon Fight), Palace and Mementos Sellables, the Summer Lottery (30k - 100k depending on your luck) and working in the Flower Shop until you reach Kindness 4. This will give you 214462 Yen. A good breakpoint to determine if you will have the required money will be checking if you have 70-90k by Mid-November. If not, I suggest you either do a mementos run for additional sellables or kill the run coz you lack money. If you're just slightly behind of money you can opt out of buying Freeze Charms and just buy them before you enter the palace with Akechi at 1/9. 

## Social Stats
For the Run it is imperative that you reach kindness 4 before the end of August or the week before you start interacting with Futaba for her social link. It is easily doable by working in the flower shop, reading kindness books and cleaning the shop. You will also need to reach Charm 3 and Knowledge 3 after Makoto's Awakening. This is needed for her Baton Pass Level Up and for Akechi's Social Link (You need to be smart enough for him to acknowledge you). You passively gain knowledge by studying at night. For charm you just need to make sure you take enough baths and answer enough classroom questions to get additional charm to hit level 3.

## End Game Comfort (For Beginners and Lazy People)
If you're not comfortable with Mementos Depths. Strive to get 11+ Iron Sands on your 2nd Mementos Run and as many stamps as you can get and put it on items. This will give you 3 Hypno Mists (and 2 craftables that require Iron Sands) to use between Okumura and Sae. Then 30+ Iron Sands by the 2nd week of November. This will allow you to have 10+ Hypno Mists to use for Shido and Mementos Depths. Overall that's ultimate comfort for Beginners and Lazy People. This does not change your required flowers for resetting Jose Stamps in Mementos 3 (or 4 since you did an extra for Iron Sand farming). You can also buy Iron Sands at roughly 3.5k each at Akihabara starting the week where you will do your 2nd Mementos Run.

## Palace Exploration and Out of Bounds
You're expected to know your way around the palace and capable of atleast doing Shido Out of Bounds The route that is listed in the notes requires Shido Out of Bounds Knowledge. Otherwise you will be unable to complete the run. The notes also will not tell you where chests or places are unless specified (Like Maruki's Color Puzzle if you're capable of even understanding that at that point of the run). 

The Other Out of Bounds skips are optional like Madarame's, Kaneshiro's and Okumura's doing them changes the route a bit but otherwise you're not losing much. You're better off getting good in fights and overall decision making than doing those skips. (You save a prolly less than 5mins-8mins in a average 12hour run doing those skips. Don't quote me on that I don't actually know).
