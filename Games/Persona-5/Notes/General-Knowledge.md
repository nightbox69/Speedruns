# General Knowledge

This is meant to be a catch all of general knowledge that can be applied to most of the Hard True Ending PC routes.

## Avoiding Fights

Always do this at all costs unless specified!!!! Experience is very tight in this run. One extra kill in the late game can mean the difference between Ann and Ryuji gaining a level before a certain fight in the 3rd term. Otherwise the additional experience will cause you to learn skills in inopportune moments where you will need the skill you will delete for the next fight. Overall, don't kill the shadows, down them with their weakness and run away. The Notes has all shadow weaknesses until Futaba. After Futaba you're just expected to either avoid the fight entirely with either a Smokescreen or a Hypno Mist as Joker will have access to Repel Physical that will kill a Shadow if they attack Joker.

## Money
You will need to have 214462 Yen before the Shido Boss Fight. This is doable by selling two Soma's (100k), Homonculus (20k, if not used in the Oberon Fight), Palace and Mementos Sellables, and working in the Flower Shop until you reach Kindness 4. This will give you 214462 Yen. A good breakpoint to determine if you will have the required money will be checking if you have 70-90k by Mid-November. If not, I suggest you either do a mementos run for additional sellables or kill the run coz you lack money.

## End Game Comfort (For Beginners and Lazy People)
If you're not comfortable with Mementos Depths. Strive to get 9 Iron Sands on your 2nd Mementos Run and as many stamps as you can get and put it on items. This will give you 3 Hypno Mists to use between Okumura and Sae. Then 30+ Iron Sands by the 2nd week of November. This will allow you to have 10+ Hypno Mists to use for Shido and Mementos Depths. Overall that's ultimate comfort for Beginners and Lazy People. This does not change your required flowers for resetting Jose Stamps in Mementos 3 (or 4 since you did an extra for Iron Sand farming).

## Palace Exploration and Out of Bounds
You're expected to know your way around the palace and capable of atleast doing Shido Out of Bounds The route that is listed in the notes requires Shido Out of Bounds Knowledge. Otherwise you will be unable to complete the run. The notes also will not tell you where chests or places are unless specified (Like Maruki's Color Puzzle if you're capable of even understanding that at that point of the run). 

The Other Out of Bounds skips are optional like Madarame's, Kaneshiro's and Okumura's doing them changes the route a bit but otherwise you're not losing much. You're better off getting good in fights and overall decision making than doing those skips. (You save a prolly less than 5mins-8mins in a average 12hour run doing those skips. Don't quote me on that I don't actually know).
