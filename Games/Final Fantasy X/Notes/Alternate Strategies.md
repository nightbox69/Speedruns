# Final Fantasy X Speedrun Alternate Strategies

## General Information

  * These are some strategies usually done by myself during my runs and some good alternates from other Runners of the game. These don't necessarily mean that the strategies are necessarily faster, they just give you more options while moving on to the game. Some strategies are also meant to save your run incase you made a mistake.
  * This isn't an Any% Guide. If you're reading this without reading the <a href="https://goo.gl/nFdPyN">Any% Notes</a> by <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/flobberworm4">Flobberworm4</a> then I recommend you read them first and run it accordingly, check back here if you made a mistake somewhere. 
  * Some of this stuff doesn't necessarily work on a Nemesis Run.
  * How to do Skips aren't included in this guide.

## Early Overdrive Sinspawn Echuilles
  
### Why shouldn't I do it?
  * If you're new to the speedrun, you probably don't know how to count AP or monster counting in Kilika (You need a minimum of 7 and sometimes, 6 monster kills. Also, Overkills count as 2). This may lead you to leave Kilika w/ barely enough AP to hit Sphere Level 5 on Tidus after Oblitzerator. This will be a problem on the Sahagins and the Garuda fights as you are left w/o Haste.
  * This strat also may force you to kill an 8th Monster as you are short by around 7 - 14 AP that was lost from Euchilles.
  * Wakka actually sucks at overkilling Bees. This forces you to do 3-4 encounters just because the Al Bhed Hater can't put his money where his mouth is.

### Why should I do it?
  * You usually leave Kilika with 8 Monster kills anyway.
  * You have a small chance to get Ice Brand after Euchilles, this ensures you overkill lizards in Kilika.
  * If you crit you're usually faster than the normal strat.
  * If Tidus crits his Overdrive you kill Euchilles before he even starts Blender.
  * You can still overkill Euchilles with a Tidus Crit.

### How to Do it
  * Tidus - Cheer
  * Wakka - Dark Attack
  * Tidus - Cheer
  * Wakka - Attack
  * Tidus - Overdrive
  * Wakka & Tidus - Attack

## Levelling with Yuna in Kilika Random Battles

### Why shouldn't I do it?
  * It involves defending with Yuna then switching her with Lulu to kill a monster, then menu'ing her back to the party.

### Why should I do it?
  * It lessens one encounter in Mushroom Rock Road in order for Yuna to level up to Sphere Level 11. Typically in a Blitzball Win scenario Yuna will Level after 3-4 Encounters.
  * Yuna has a 12% chance to go first before Tidus and is faster than Wakka so it's free AP for her.

### How do I do it?
  * Switch Kimahri with Wakka on or after the Ragora Fight.
  * Defend with Yuna during an encounter then switch out with Lulu during fights where she's needed.
  * Switch Yuna back to the party after the fight.

Typically, I just let Yuna in the party for 4-5 monster(2 encounters) kills then let Lulu in for the rest.

## Skipping Wakka's Rulebreaker
  Wakka's Rulebreaker is a strategy in order for you to be able to kill Garuda's in Mushroon Rock Road. While it is a good strategy, Garuda's are typically bad encounters to fight.

### Why shouldn't I do it?
  * You lost Blitzball. Or atleast isn't confident in winning it.
  * There is a chance that you get the Only Garuda MRR. (It'll suck to be in your shoes on that instance w/o Rulebreaker, my condolences btw.)

### Why should you do it?

  * You won Blitzball, and Tidus doesn't exactly help in the Garuda killing (aside from hasting).
  * Garudas aren't exactly common in Mushroom Rock Road.
  * Garudas drop Power Spheres and you don't need more of these. Sure, you get AP but this may cause a short of Speed Spheres (or a minor issue of Mana Spheres) that you would be forced to farm in Thunder Plains and Bikanel.
  * Getting Rulebreaker requires you to talk to Oaka give out Gil before the Machina Fights in Luca to sell your items and buy Rulebreaker. This forces you to sell another lot of items on Mushroom Rock Road just to get Sentry. Skipping Rulebreaker enables you to just sell 1 Elixir, Hunter's Spear, Tough Bangle and 500gil - 1000gil worth of Weapons to get it. Practically shaving off your menu'ing by 3/4's.
  * Garuda encounters aren't fast for a one monster encounter.
  * You ironically break the rules by not following Flobber's notes.

  **Note: There has been instances of Runners killing their run due to a massive overpopulation of Garuda encounters but it rarely happens. You're far more likely to kill your run from an ambush or from a turn-order mistake than from not being able to kill Garudas. But, it happens and I wouldn't be surpised if it also happens consecutively.**

### How to Do it
  * Give Oaka 1100gil on the Ship going to Luca where he introduces himself first in a speedrun (Oaka is actually onboard the ship going to Kilika but this isn't relevant on a speedrun).
  * Ignore Oaka in Luca and head straight to the Machina Fights.

## Oblitzerator 

  The Strategy revolves on how fast you can reach Sphere Level 5 on Tidus, and if you got Lightning Steel early. 

### Early Haste
  With good Kilika RNG you can leave Kilika just after two 3-monster encounters. Sometimes, you'll have the intention of overfarming Kilika. Personally, I found that you'd waste more time overfarming in Kilika just so you can get a fast Oblizerator. Also, the Machina and Oblitz fights aren't really fights you should even prepare haste for. But, for the folks out there who likes to overfarm Kilika here's a guideline of how many monsters you need to kill just to get to early haste, I'm just rough outlining the parts where you can reasonably use Haste (I only did up until the 14-16 one). Do note that if you get early haste you have one chance to cast it before you reach a save sphere and if Tidus has full MP with Haste, 3 times.

  * 7-8 Monster Kills (63-72 AP) - Haste After Oblitz
  * 9-10 Monster Kills (81-90 AP) - Haste Before Oblitz
  * 14-16 Monster Kills (126-144 AP) - Haste Before the 3 continous Machina Fight
  * 20-22 Monster Kills (180 - 198 AP) - Shit Kilika and Tidus Level 5.

  If you go the 20-22 Monster Kill Direction then start hasting Lulu on the 2nd machina fight onwards, and then top her HP if she's low before Oblitz.

### Oblitz Fight
  If you got Lightning Steel Early (You can get it by chance as early as the 1st Tutorial Battle with Wakka) then you should prolly consider Ronso Rage - Seed Cannon Oblitz as your last Attack.

#### Why shouldn't I do it?
  * You lose your 20% Chance to get Lightning Steel. So only do this if you got Lightning Steel earlier than expected.

#### Why should you do it?
  * You got Lightning Steel somewhere you shouldn't be getting it.
  * Faster Animation than Lulu Thunder.
  * If it crits, you'll have more elixirs to sell to Oaka. Double chances of getting Thunder Ball too (2.5% for two weapons).

#### How to do it
  * Kimahri - Ronso Rage - Seed Cannon after Tidus uses the crane.

## Blitzball

### General Information
  There are alot of stuff that we can go on about Blitzball and there are a lot of strategies involving it. But, here are some general stuff before we move on:

  * Winning Blitzball isn't required to finish the speedrun. Yes, it is faster but only by some 2-3minutes. The only parts of the run where the Strength Sphere will matter are Mushroom Rock Road, Seymour 1, possibly Wendigo, Evrae, and Seymour 2.
  * Crits in Blitzball exist but how they crit is still up in the air.
  * If the Luca Goers want to score. They are going to score.
  * If they want to troll, They are going to troll. They are also called Luca Trollers for a reason.
  * Interactions between players pauses the timer, so do your menuing fast. Also breaks doesn't start the timer. So don't even try to break unless you're scoring and you're not going to survive a break with multiple goers so don't even attempt it.
  * Jassu vs. Abus is the only exception of the break scenario. Jassu will survive a break with Abus 1v1.
  * Buffer your movement during a pass. Rule of thumb is to just look at your minimap during movement. Your movement will be according to your minimap direction and will not change regardless of any camera changes so don't confuse yourself. 
  * Blitzball isn't that chaotic if you know what you're doing.

  If you're going to speedrun this game understanding how blitzball works is great as you'll be going to be salty at this minigame for long, long, long time. There are going to be a lot of scenarios that can happen in Blitzball. You'll prolly learn the basics with around 3-4hours of playing this minigame repeatedly.

### Graav and Balgerda
  These two will make or break your Blitzball game. First, you do not want Graav passing the ball to Bickson or Abus. Frankly speaking, you don't want the ball to be in any of their hands at all. Second, Graav can level up depending on how the 1st half played out giving him access to Venom Tackle, when Graav is level 4 you don't want him to be near you. And lastly, Graav is overall the Pitboss of Blitzball. Any interactions with Graav will result in Graav winning, he can simply plow through you if he wants to.

  Balgerda, she is a minor threat but don't take her lightly. You want to lure her out of her position with Jassu to prevent her from breaking with your shooter (Tidus or Wakka) but sometimes Balgerda just won't budge. Simply break with her and pray that she doesn't block you. Balgerda is very much known to grab the ball during key instances of scoring, it's like she can smell your fear of her.

### Hiding behind Keepa or the Jassu Train 
  It's a bit of both actually, if you get the blitz off you almost probably want to hide behind the goalie with either Letty or Botta. While I like the Jassu Train it closes off the possibility of being able to pass to other players to score or potentially get Jassu cornered if you move badly enough. Hiding with Botta also opens up Jassu to a pass incase the Goers realizes you are just hiding behind the Goalie. Look into your mini map if you see a weird Graav coming straight at you from the goal post then pass immediately to Jassu and start the Train.

  "Choo Choo, Mothafuckas"- ChrisTenarium™

  ![Jassu Train](https://i.imgur.com/IbcIWvr.jpg)

#### Hiding behind Keepa
  I usually just pass to Botta and have him be the one to hide behind the Goalie for these reasons: 

  * Letty tends to drag Graav with him to the goal post.
  * Botta is closer to the Goal Post.

  You can drag the Goers to you especially during the very first blitzoff where you have to switch modes to gain control of the players. With good knowledge of what you're going to do you can safely pass the ball to botta and have him swim to Keepa. There is a small chance of the Goers realizing they are being bugged out so keep a close look at your minimap and pass immediately to Jassu, have him swim to the southeast corner while checking who is chasing you. If Graav is on to you start the Jassu Train immediately, if it's only Abus break pass back to Botta if he's clear of any enemies or break dribble and swim back to the goalie, pass to Botta when the coast is clear.

### Blitzball Crits
  Basically, when an interaction occurs between players you get either get a +/-5 (rounded up or down) roll on defense. So you can sometimes see Keepa not being able to catch a 3SH shot by Graav or Balgerda tackling Wakka with 12HP on a 8atk during a break. So with this in mind, you really do not want the Goers to be near the ball at any given time. We are yet to confirm if crits occur on both sides of the interaction or which way it is rounded. But, if this is true then the scenario of Abus rolling a +5 while Jassu rolls a -5 is possible (this is the only way for Abus to get the ball from Jassu btw).

### Scoring
  Blitzball Enemy AI goes haywire and becomes more aggresive the moment you score, so keep this in mind. You want to score at the last possible moment where the Goers cannot react effectively to mount a counter-attack against you. This is where Jassu comes into play, you need atleast minute for Jassu to get to the ball, head to the other corner, lure Balgerda out of defense and pass the ball to your scorer while only breaking with Abus. Jassu does most of heavy work for Blitzball. Now with your scorer you want to move as close to the goalie as possible without entering a break scenario with Doram or Graav. Check your minimap. If they are about to break with you shoot immediately. You're usually left with around 30-20seconds after the pass to score so if the attempt fails or succeeds the possibility of the Goers counterattack succeeding is technically minimal. The AI behavior also resets after every stop of the game (1st Half, Tidus Leaving).

### Tidus Strategies
  This is where Runners diverge on how they play the run out. We have Sphere Shot Strats, Jecht Shot Strats, Wakka Strats, and 1st Half Score Strats. 1st Half, Sphere Shot and Jecht Shot are all Tidus Strats. Wakka Strats is when Wakka comes into play. All of these strats come with their own disadvantages and runners and viewers alike have their own opinion regarding these. Personally, I've had a blitzball where I won with a score of 3-2 so I've technically used all these strats. So, pick your poison and go from there. Again, if the Goers want to score, they will score whether you like it or not. 

#### Why I shouldn't do it?
  * Scoring with Tidus may open the chance get a Goer Score in the last 2 minutes and result to an overtime.
  * Tidus leaves the game after the 3rd minute of the 2nd half. If you haven't scored with Tidus after then you're left with Wakka.
  * Scoring with Tidus usually leaves game time for the Goers to score back if you're irresponsible with time management. Blitzball AI goes haywire and gets more aggresive if you score first. If you're not confident on your Blitzball I must suggest to practice Wakka strats first so you get an idea what time you should be scoring before you attempt Tidus Strats.
  * Scores pause the timer for a bit. (Except when you get the score before the "Time's Up" message or the Wakka Cutscene appears.)
  * Tidus Strategies doesn't mean you'll win Blitzball. It just gives you more leeway to score.

#### Why should I do it?
  * Tidus has access to Sphere Shot(or Jecht Shot) which allows you to potentially skip breaking with Balgerda and shooting immediately.
  * Tidus has faster movespeed than Wakka which allows him to outrun the goers for a little bit without getting into a break. Having said that, the goers will catch up to Tidus soon enough so don't expect you can do a Tidus Train.
  * If the Goers get the Ball in the last 2 minutes you either Lose, not get enough time to score with Wakka or the Goers troll follow Jassu, or be lucky and succeed scoring with Wakka.
  * This gives you with 2-3 opportunities to score(Wakka Strats included). So retaliation against the Goers isn't that far out of reach.

#### Should I get Jecht Shot?
  It depends on you actually. The reason why runners opt out of Jecht Shot is because the cutscenes get longer on the ship going to Luca. You also need to note that Jecht Shot has a maximum 20seconds animation (excluding ball travel time) vs. Sphere Shot with a 10second animation, so time it right before you attempt to score(2:35 is the bare minimum for shooting and anything more will have you cry "Sayonara" to your strategy). The advantages are that you don't need to break with Balgerda (or if the gods really don't want you to win, Graav) because Jecht Shot with will deal with them. So, if you feel like going toe to toe with the Goers with Jecht Shot then feel completely free. Just note that if you didn't score with Jecht Shot then your efforts are all in vain. Personally, I don't like to use Jecht Shot but I also see the advantages of getting it. If you're not relatively confident on luring Balgerda out then this strategy is for you.

#### How to do it
  I have to explain the end goal first. You want experience with Tidus during the first half then score on the 2nd half optimally. You can do this two ways. First is that you have to pass with Tidus, Tidus has 3 PA so you have to move back a little to your receiver to prevent any fumbles (usually to Jassu). The 2nd One is to shoot with Tidus. If you manage to get into any breaks with Tidus during the first half I'll prioritize getting exp with Tidus so I would opt out of any breaks and give the goers the ball and hope for the best. The 2nd One is to shoot with Tidus in the first half, and again on the 2nd half for good measure. 

##### If Letty gets the ball
  * Letty - Directions(Triangle) - Manual A, Normal
  * Letty - Pass - Botta
  * Botta - Move behind Keepa and look into your HP, if your HP is above 6 and the goers are far away pass to Jassu and have him swim to Keepa, otherwise move to the southeast corner near Jassu and pass to him. You want want the ball to be in Jassu's hands around 3:40 - 3:55
  * Jassu - Move to the northwest corner while being chased by just Abus. Move near Balgerda and lure her out of range of Tidus. Break with Abus and Pass to Tidus
  * Tidus - Move as close as close to the Goalie as you can w/o getting breaks and shoot. Just shoot if you get any breaks.
  * Change directions to right side after shooting (regardless if you scored, got blocked by a defender or a goalie)

##### If Graav gets the Ball
  * Directions - Mark wait until Letty is near Graav then Change back to Normal
  * Graav - Will either dribble break, shoot break or pass break with Letty.
  * On Shoot Break - Pray to the Lords Keepa Catches it and he will pass to some member of the team have pass the ball to Botta (be mindful of your PA). 
  * On Dribble Break - Graav will break with Botta and Jassu and will Shoot or Pass. If he shoots Keepa will most certainly catch it.
  * On Pass Break - Directions - Right Side and be ready to bleed seconds.
  * Proceed with Letty gets the ball strats.

##### 2nd Half
  * Equip Tidus with Jecht Shot if you have it.
  * Proceed with Letty Strats if you get the blitz off and Graav Strats if the Graav get it. You want the ball to be in Jassu w/ only Abus chasing him by 1:40, shoot with Tidus with your skill shot around 2:40 or 2:35. 
  * Hide behind the goalie or Jassu Train when Wakka enters the fray. You would like to shoot with Wakka if you manage to tie the game. 

## Early Yuna OD Charge

### Why shouldn't I do it
  * You lose out on the chance of getting Auron hit for his OD on Mi'hen Highroad.
  * You can accidentally summon Valefor for no apparent use whatsoever.
  * If the monsters hate Yuna you'll have to switch her on the Thunder Plains instead.

### Why should I do it. 
  * Yuna is already in the party on Mi'hen so you can skip menu'ing.
  * If you get into a Bomb Encounter you can easily switch Kimahri and Flee with Tidus w/o problems.
  * If you get a low HP Yuna on Mi'hen you can easily switch her now with Auron saving you the hassle of healing 1 party member.
  * You can skip charging OD with Yuna in the Thunder Plains Iron Giant.
  * Auron can charge OD naturally through the Thunder Plains and Macalania Encounters.

### How to do it
  * Mi'hen Highroad - Yuna, Wakka, Tidus, just defend with Yuna if she goes first and have Tidus Flee
  * Bomb Encounter - Switch Tidus or Yuna with Kimahri and Lancet the Bomb. Switch back to Tidus then Flee. You can opt to switch her back but unless I got the bomb encounter on the 1st and 2nd Section of Mi'hen I typically leave her in reserve.
  * Old Road - Chocobo Eater - Haste Chocobo Eater then switch Wakka and Kimahri with Yuna and Auron (If Yuna is still in the party before this fight then just switch the other guy with Auron). Pray to the Gods Chocobo Eater punches Yuna.
  * Old Road - Proceed with Mi'hen Highroad Strats, with the Party being Auron, Tidus, and Yuna.

## Mushroom Rock Road
  Mushroom Rock Road differs a lot depending if you won or lost Blitzball. Heck, this is arguably the only split where Blitzball actually matters in regards to actual big timeloss. On a Blitzball win you just need to get 3-4 Encounters to level your party and trudge on forward. However, a Blitzball loss is a different story as you typically take around 4-6 encounters if you happen to not overkill any monsters, and you also have to buy Ice Brand if you don't have it just so Tidus can kill lizards. This is where you are typically heavily punished for a Blitzball loss.

### Early Remedy
  There's a Remedy Chest in the left corner of the big right turn while walking to MRR. I would only pick this up if I'm looking for a specific encounter. This would allow you to skip getting the Remedy in Macalania and maybe prevent one extra encounter from popping up there.

### Blitzball Win
  * Pray that Tidus's Overdrive gets charged before MRR. Don't force to charge the Overdrive.

#### Old Road
  * Party by Chocobo Eater - Auron, Tidus, Yuna
  * Fight one of these encounters MRR Style if you get it on a pre-emptive, or normal. Flee during Ambushes. Note: You don't need to farm this encounter. Your 1st two encounters in MRR before the ravine also has a chance for these so get them even on an ambush, this may save you from looking for encounters in the actual levelling section.
  ![Old Road Encounter1](https://i.imgur.com/qka4Tpr.png)
  ![Old Road Encounter2](https://i.imgur.com/1LDhHSR.png)

  **Be aware that you will naturally incur a timeloss on the Old Road split.** This fight is considered as your first fight on the MRR Encounter Fight Counter. It saves you from having to search for blue lizards. Ignore these when you actually reach MRR, you want to get away from that section as fast as possible.

#### Mushroom Rock Road - Ravine Battles
  * Only fight the encounters that has this until you hit the right beside the Remedy Chest. Fight any non-garuda encounter after turning right according to Flobber's Notes if you haven't reached Yuna's Sphere Level. Personally, I wait until the last left turn before I start whacking encounters.
  ![MRR Encounter 1](https://i.imgur.com/OgaemVk.png)
  * You want to switch Tidus with Auron first and killing the Big Lizard first. This fight can be slow as the Big Lizard has an AOE that kill Lulu outright. After killing it proceed with the usual MRR Strats. If you crit this big guy then do the 3rd noted encounter with Lulu Fire - Auron Physical Attack on the funguar(Not the other way around). 
  ![MRR Encounter 2](https://i.imgur.com/7LRBu1o.png)
  * If Tidus has Overdrive and you get this as your 2nd Fight - Overdrive the mushroom with Tidus then proceed with usual MRR Strats. Otherwise consider this as a normal fight and cast Fire first with Lulu then a Normal Attack from Auron (Or Flee, as the Funguar can Pollen counterattack). 
  ![MRR Encounter 3](https://i.imgur.com/icLqiej.png)

  **You will lose Tidus OD on Extractor if you do the 3rd encounter as specified. But you won Blitzball, simply just whack away with Tidus and Wakka on Extractor after hasting(Tidus crits damage for 900 - 1k also, just defend with Wakka if you have Lightning Steel).**

### Blitzball Loss
  These are strats done by <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/ze_ak">ze_ak</a> on his WR run for the JP Any% Version. It is a good strat to do on a Blitzball loss as it also drops the MRR Encounter Fights to 3 encounters (Two maybe possible with one more overkill). More testing is needed for this strat. I found that the Funguar as well as the Red Element can potentially kill Valefor before she can her 2nd Element.

#### Mushroom Rock Road - Ravine Battles
  * Get your first encounter - Defend with Kimahri, Lulu, Tidus.
  * Switch Yuna, summon Valefor and overdrive energy blast. 
  * Find an encounter with 1 Funguar or a Red Element, Kill monters that aren't specified as normal. Only fight one more encounter that doesn't have these monsters. Then start searching.
  * Switch Yuna, summon Valefor, Boost once and cast Fire(Funguar) or Blizzard(Red Element) until you kill it.
  * Keep fighting encounters as the notes says until you reach Yuna's Sphere Level.

## Thunder Plains

### Shop Skip
  You can skip buying phoenix down's and grenades at the shop and buy Phoenix Downs instead at Oaka, saving you some seconds. Bribing Sand Wolves may potentially net you 15 Sleeping Powders for 3 extra for BFA and you can steal some Grenades from the machina fight anyway. Personally, I buy 4 grenades at the shop to use on the Buers, Iron Giant Encounter just so I don't to find one more to charge OD on. Shop Skip is only faster if you get 15 Sleeping Powders and at a trivial amount at that.

## Bikanel Island
  Sometimes in you'll be in a pinch in Bikanel Island, either you don't get Lulu's Sphere Level to the appropriate levels or you don't have Silence Grenades for Home. Some of these strats are meant to save you and one is arguably faster than the usual strat(but hella riskier too). But they are situational, so if this happens to you look here.

### Levelling Lulu
  If you forgot to give Lulu a turn on Seymour, Crawler, Spherimorph then you'll have to level her here on Bikanel to get Bribe.

  * You can level Lulu either with Tidus killing the Big Green Lizard or Mix - Grenade with Rikku on a Cactuar (Make sure Lulu gets a turn before you kill either).
  * Proceed to the usual Home Strats.

### Farplane Shadow
  Sometimes Anima will give you a rare Farplane Shadow (or two. You (un)lucky bastard) and refuse to give out Silence Grenades. You can use them on the Sandragora Fights to easily kill them, saving Kimahri his OD for use on the Bombs. **Farplane Shadow can miss so yes, this is risky to do.**

  * 1st Sandragora Fight - Tidus, Defend - Rikku - Use Farplane Shadow
  * 2nd Sandragora Fight - Repeat if you have an extra Farplane Shadow, otherwise normal Auron Strats.
  * Bomb Fight - Switch Kimahri - OD - Stone Breath. 
  * Proceed on normal strats.

### 10,000 Gil Chest
  If you happen to come across a weapon like Mage Masher before Bikanel then I highly suggest you skip this. Getting this chest guarantees you 1-2 encounters that you have to run away from. This is very subjective but it saved me a couple of times where this chest saved me from being short of money by calm lands (Minimum Bribe is 35k per Flan and I would have gotten 65k if it weren't for this chest.) Also Bribe Reward amount is purely RNG so even if you got the minimum amount of money(or even 100k Gil) it doesn't guarantee you getting 24 Fire Gems from the Flans.

  * Get this 10k Gil Chest when you reach it.
  ![Bikanel Chest](https://i.imgur.com/trJVLUu.png)

## Evrae
  Sometimes you would forget to switch Auron out of the Party for Tidus at Home. This wastes time, and as such unless you're like 20minutes++ ahead of your PB I would rather opt out of it and just kill my run. This works great to keep marathons or races alive tho.

### How to do it
  * Rikku - Pull back
  * Kimahri - Defend or Heal Self when Attacked
  * Once Pulled back - Revive party members and / or Switch Auron with Tidus, Haste Tidus
  * Rikku - Mix Map and Luck Sphere
  * Kimahri - Mega Potion
  * Tidus - Go Back to Evrae
  * Continue to usual Evrae Strats

## Isaaru
  Due to problems during the Spherimorph, forgetting to give a turn to Yuna, or you completely forgot to Charge Yuna's OD then you'll have to do some of these Strats here. Also, this wastes time so unless you're massively ahead of your PB I would rather opt out of these strats. This also keeps marathons and races alive for the masochists out there who doesn't want to kill this kind of a run. 

### Summon Ixion or Charge Yuna OD
  **Definitely, charge Yuna OD.** The only instance you would want to use Ixion is when you forgot to give Yuna a turn at Crawler or Seymour 1 (If you forgot both I presume you did Special Sphere Strats or else I'd be wondering how you're even here) because levelling Yuna to the appropriate Sphere Level is longer than 2 Full Aeon Overdrive and Summon animations.

### Charge Yuna OD
  * 1st Larva Fight (Unescapable) - Charge Valefor OD, dismiss, kill with Thundaga then Save Sphere.
  * 2nd Larva Fight - Defend with Yuna, escape with Auron, keep using Hi-Potions(or defend on High HP, X-Potion or Elixir on crit HP) until Yuna's OD is Full, kill with Thundaga
  * Proceed with the usual Isaaru Strats

### Summon Ixion
  * 1st Larva Fight (Unescapable) - Boost Valefor OD, dismiss, kill with Thundaga then Save Sphere.
  * 2nd Larva Fight - Shield once with Shiva then Blizzard once, then keep hitting yourself with Blizzara until she fills OD.
  * Proceed with usual Isaaru Strats until his Valefor.
  * Isaaru Valefor - Summon Ixion - Thundara twice, then boost to fill OD, then Overdrive - Thor's Hammer.
  * Isaaru Bahamut - Summon Shiva - Blizzara five times, and if he's still not below 10k then attacking before he OD's, then OD - Diamond Dust.
  * Before Seymour 2 - Get everything you have to get on Yuna's Grid that you can.
  * Seymour 2 - Yuna - Change Weapon - Switch Yuna with Rikku. Let Rikku die. (**Ignore this is Yuna is already good to go, the only case of you needing Yuna to live is when she's still short of AP**)
  * After Seymour 2 - Get everything you have to get on Yuna's Grid that you can. 

## Mana Spheres
  You also need 14 Mana Spheres for the entire run. You can naturally farm a lot but a minimum encounter Kilika and a MRR Encounter Count w/o the Mana Sphere monsters can lead to this kind of shortage problem. So if you're gunning down for encounters in MRR I suggest you get the fights with the Red Elements in MRR and the Lightning Flan in Old Road. If you have an extra grenade then throw it on the encounters with Aerouges (Flying Red Guys) at the Thunder plains, or buy 1 extra grenade to use when you see them on the 2nd part of the Thunder Plains.
