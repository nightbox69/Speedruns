# Final Fantasy X Speedrun Alternate Strategies

## General Information

  * These are some strategies usually done by myself during my runs and some good alternates from other Runners of the game. These don't necessarily mean that the strategies are necessarily faster, they just give you more options while moving on to the game.
  * This isn't an Any% Guide. If you're reading this w/o reading the Any% Notes by <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/flobberworm4">Flobberworm4</a> or has yet to speedrun the game then you're either probably lost or attempting to do something that would confuse you in the middle of the run. Do the run first before you attempt any of these so you get the idea of what is happening in the game. 
  * Some of this stuff doesn't necessarily work on a Nemesis Run.
  * Skips aren't included in this guide.

## Early Overdrive Sinspawn Echuilles
  
### Why shouldn't I do it?
  * If you're new to the speedrun, you probably don't know how to count AP or monster counting in Kilika (You need a minimum of 7 and sometimes, 6 monster kills. Also, Overkills count as 2). This may lead you to leave Kilika w/ barely enough AP to hit Sphere Level 5 on Tidus after Oblitzerator. This will be a problem on the Sahagins and the Garuda fights as you are left w/o Haste.
  * This strat also may force you to kill an 8th Monster as you are short by around 7 - 14 AP that was lost from Euchilles.
  * Wakka actually sucks at overkilling Bees. This forces you to do 3-4 encounters just because the Al Bhed Hater can't put his money where his mouth is.

### Why should I do it?
  * You usually leave Kilika with 8 Monster kills anyway.
  * You have a small chance to get Ice Brand after Euchilles, this ensures you overkill lizards in Kilika.
  * If you crit you're usually faster than the normal strat.
  * If Tidus crits his Overdrive you kill Euchilles before he even starts Blender.
  * You can still overkill Euchilles with a Tidus Crit.

### How to Do it
  * Tidus - Cheer
  * Wakka - Dark Attack
  * Tidus - Cheer
  * Wakka - Attack
  * Tidus - Overdrive
  * Wakka & Tidus - Attack

## Levelling with Yuna in Kilika Random Battles

### Why shouldn't I do it?
  * It involves defending with Yuna then switching her with Lulu to kill a monster, then menu'ing her back to the party.

### Why should I do it?
  * It lessens one encounter in Mushroom Rock Road in order for Yuna to level up to Sphere Level 11. Typically in a Blitzball Win scenario Yuna will Level after 3-4 Encounters.
  * Yuna has a 12% chance to go first before Tidus so it's technically free AP for her.

### How do I do it?
  * Switch Kimahri with Wakka on or after the Ragora Fight.
  * Defend with Yuna during an encounter then switch out with Lulu during fights where she's needed.
  * Switch Yuna back to the party after the fight.

Typically, I just let Yuna in the party for 4-5 monster(2 encounters) kills then let Lulu in for the rest.

## Skipping Wakka's Rulebreaker

### Why shouldn't I do it?
  * You lost blitzball. Or atleast isn't confident in winning it.
  * There is a chance that you get the Only Garuda MRR. (It'll suck to be in your shoes on that instance w/o Rulebreaker, my condolences btw.)

### Why should you do it?
  
  Wakka's Rulebreaker is a strategy in order for you to be able to kill Garuda's in Mushroon Rock Road, while it is a good strategy. You don't really wanna kill Garuda's for these reasons: 

    * You won Blitzball, and Tidus doesn't exactly help in the Garuda killing (aside from hasting).
    * Garudas aren't exactly common in Mushroom Rock Road. Do note that there has been instances of Runners killing their run due to a massive overpopulation of Garuda encounters there but it's not exactly happening that often. You're more likely to kill your run from an ambush than from not being able to kill Garudas.
    * Garudas drop Power Spheres and you don't need more of these. Sure, you get AP but this may cause a short of Speed Spheres (or a minor issue of Mana Spheres) that you would be forced to farm in Thunder Plains and Bikanel.
    * Getting Rulebreaker requires you to talk to Oaka give out Gil before the Machina Fights in Luca to sell your items and buy Rulebreaker. This forces you to sell another lot of items on Mushroom Rock Road just to get Sentry. Skipping Rulebreaker enables you to just sell 1 Elixir, Hunter's Spear, Tough Bangle and 500gil - 1000gil worth of Weapons to get it. Practically shaving off your menu'ing by 3/4's.
    * Garuda encounters aren't exactly fast for a one monster encounter.
    * You ironically break the rules by not following Flobber's notes.

### How to Do it
  * Give Oaka 1100gil on the Ship going to Luca where he introduces himself first in a speedrun (Oaka is actually onboard the ship going to Kilika but this isn't relevant on a speedrun).
  * Ignore Oaka in Luca and head straight to the Machina Fights.

## Blitzball

### General Information
  There are alot of stuff that we can go on about blitzball and there are a lot of strategies involving it. But, here are some general stuff before move on:

    * Winning Blitzball isn't required to finish the speedrun. Yes, it is faster but only by some 2-3minutes. The only parts of the run where the Strength Sphere will matter is Mushroom Rock Road, Seymour 1, possibly Wendigo, Evrae, and Seymour 2.
    * Crits in Blitzball exist but how they crit is still up in the air.
    * If the Luca Goers want to score. They are going to score.
    * If they want to troll, They are going to troll. They are also called Luca Trollers for a reason.
    * Interactions between players pauses the timer, so do your menuing fast. Also breaks doesn't start the timer. So don't even try to break unless you're scoring and you're not going to survive a break with multiple goers so don't even attempt it.
    * Jassu vs Abus is the only exception of the break scenario. Jassu will survive a break with Abus 1v1.
    * Buffer your movement during a pass. Rule of thumb is to just look at your minimap during movement. Your movement will be according to your minimap direction and will not change regardless of any camera changes so don't confuse yourself. 
    * If you really want to win Blitzball, you got to practice it. 

### Graav and Balgerda
  These two will make or break your Blitzball game. First, you do not want Graav passing the ball to Bickson or Abus. Frankly speaking, you don't want the ball to be in any of their hands at all. Second, Graav can level up depending on how the 1st half played out giving him access to Venom Tackle, when Graav is level 4 you don't want him to be near you. And lastly, Graav is overall the Pitboss of Blitzball. Any interactions with Graav will result in Graav winning, he can simply plow through you if he wants to.

  Balgerda, she is a minor threat but don't take her lightly. You want to lure her out of her position with Jassu to prevent her from breaking with your shooter (Tidus or Wakka) but sometimes Balgerda just won't budge. Simply break with her and pray that she doesn't block you. Balgerda is very much known to grab the ball during key instances of scoring, it's like she can smell your fear of her.

### Hiding behind Keepa or the Jassu Train
  It's a bit of both actually, if you get the blitz off you almost probably want to hide behind the goalie with either Letty or Botta. While I like the Jassu train it closes off the possibility of being able to pass to other players to score or potentially get Jassu cornered if you move badly enough. Hiding with Botta also opens up Jassu to a pass incase the Goers realizes you are just hiding behind the Goalie. Look into your mini map if you see a weird Graav coming straight at you from the goal post then pass immediately to Jassu and start the train.

#### Hiding behind Keepa
  I usually just pass to Botta and have him be the one to hide behind the goalie for these reasons: 

    * Letty tends to drag Graav with him to the goal post especially during the very first blitzoff where you have to switch modes to gain control of the players. You don't want the Goers to be near anyone of your players who is holding the ball.
    * Botta is closer to the Goal Post.

### Tidus Strategies

#### Why I shouldn't do it?
  * Scoring with Tidus may open the chance get a Goer Score in the last 2 minutes and result to an overtime.
  * Tidus leaves the game after the 3rd minute of the 2nd half. If you haven't scored with Tidus after then you're left with Wakka.
  * Scoring with Tidus usually leaves game time for the Goers to score back if you're irresponsible with time management. Blitzball AI goes haywire and gets more aggresive if you score first. If you're not confident on your Blitzball I must suggest to practice Wakka strats first so you get an idea what time you should be scoring before you attempt Tidus Strats.
  * Scores pause the timer for a bit. (Except when you get the score before the "Time's Up" message appears.)
  * Tidus Strategies doesn't mean you'll win Blitzball. It just gives you more leeway to score.

#### Why should I do it?
  * Tidus has access to Sphere Shot(or Jecht Shot) which allows you to potentially skip breaking with Balgerda and shooting immediately.
  * Tidus has faster movespeed than Wakka which allows him to outrun the goers for a little bit without getting into a break. Having said that, the goers will catch up to Tidus soon enough so don't expect you can do a Tidus Train.
  * If you time your scores correctly, the Goers won't have time to score. I usually leave around 15-20secs of gametime to make sure I can have ample space to get the ball to Tidus and score before the timer.
  * Wakka sucks statwise. 

#### Should I get Jecht Shot?
  It depends on you actually. The reason why runners opt out of Jecht Shot is because the cutscenes get longer on the ship going to Luca. You also need to note that Jecht Shot has a maximum 20seconds animation (excluding ball travel time), so time it right before you attempt to score(2:35 is the bare minimum for shooting and anything more will have you cry sayonara to your sacrifice). The advantages are that you don't need to break with Balgerda (or if the gods really don't want you to win, Graav) coz Jecht Shot with will deal with them. So if you feel like going toe to toe with the Goers with Jecht Shot then feel completely free. Just note that if you didn't score with Jecht Shot then your efforts are all in vain.

#### How to do it
  I have to explain the end goal first. You want experience with Tidus during the first half then score on the 2nd half optimally. You can do this two ways. First is that you have to pass with Tidus, Tidus has 3 PA so you have to move back a little to your receiver to prevent any fumbles (usually to Jassu). The 2nd One is to shoot with Tidus. If you manage to get into any breaks with Tidus during the first half I'll prioritize getting exp with Tidus so I would opt out of any breaks and give the goers the ball and hope for the best. The 2nd One is to shoot with Tidus in the first half, and again on the 2nd half for good measure. 

##### If Letty gets the ball
  * Letty - Directions(Triangle) - Manual A, Normal
  * Letty - Pass - Botta
  * Botta - Move behind Keepa and look into your HP, if your HP is above 6 and the goers are far away pass to Jassu and have him swim to Keepa, otherwise move to the southeast corner near Jassu and pass to him. You want want the ball to be in Jassu's hands around 3:40 - 3:55
  * Jassu - Move to the northwest corner while being chased by just Abus. Move near Balgerda and lure her out of range of Tidus. Break with Abus and Pass to Tidus
  * Tidus - Move as close as close to the Goalie as you can w/o getting breaks and shoot. Just shoot if you get any breaks.
  * Change directions to right side after shooting (regardless if you scored, got blocked by a defender or a goalie)

##### If Graav gets the Ball
  * Directions - Mark wait until Letty is near Graav then Change back to Normal
  * Graav - Will either dribble break, shoot break or pass break with Letty.
  * On Shoot Break - Pray to the Lords Keepa Catches it and he will pass to some member of the team have pass the ball to Botta (be mindful of your PA). 
  * On Dribble Break - Graav will break with Botta and Jassu and will Shoot or Pass. If he shoots Keepa will most certainly catch it.
  * On Pass Break - Directions - Right Side and be ready to bleed seconds.
  * Proceed with Letty gets the ball strats.

##### 2nd Half
  * Equip Tidus with Jecht Shot if you have it.
  * Proceed with Letty Strats if you get the blitz off and Graav Strats if the Graav get it. You want the ball to be in Jassu w/ only Abus chasing him by 1:40, shoot with Tidus with your skill shot around 2:40 or 2:35. 
  * Hide behind the goalie or Jassu Train when Wakka enters the fray. You would like to shoot with Wakka if you manage to tie the game. 

## Mushroom Rock Road
  Mushroom Rock Road differs a lot depending if you won or lost blitzball. Heck, this is arguably the only split where blitzball actually matters in regards to actual timeloss.

### Blitzball Win
  * Pray that Tidus's Overdrive gets charged before MRR. Don't force to charge the Overdrive.

#### Old Road
  * Party by Chocobo Eater - Auron, Tidus, Yuna
  * Fight one of these encounters MRR Style if you get it on a pre-emptive, or normal. Flee during Ambushes. Note: You don't need to farm this encounter. If you don't get it then proceed directly to MRR.

  ![Old Road Encounter2](https://i.imgur.com/1LDhHSR.png)

  **Be aware that you will naturally incur a timeloss on the split** 

#### Mushroom Rock Road - Battles
  * Only fight the encounters that has this until you hit right on MRR Fight Section. Fight any non-garuda encounter after turning right according to Flobber's Notes if you haven't reached Yuna's Sphere Level.
  ![MRR Encounter 1](https://i.imgur.com/OgaemVk.png)
  ![MRR Encounter 2](https://i.imgur.com/7LRBu1o.png)
  * If Tidus has Overdrive and you get this as your 2nd Fight - Overdrive the mushroom with Tidus then proceed with usual MRR Strats.
  
  ![MRR Encounter 3](https://i.imgur.com/icLqiej.png)

  **You will lose Tidus OD on Extractor. But you won blitzball, simply just whack away with Tidus and Wakka on Extractor after hasting(Tidus crits damage for 900 - 1k also, just defend with Wakka if you have Lightning Steel).**

### Blitzball Loss
  These are strats done by <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/ze_ak">ze_ak</a> on his WR run for the JP Any% Version. It technically is a good strat to do on a blitzball loss.

#### Mushroom Rock Road - Battles
  * Get your first encounter - Defend with Kimahri, Lulu, Tidus.
  * Switch Yuna, summon Valefor and overdrive energy blast.
  * Fight as normal until you find a mushroom encounter. Kill the non-mushrooms. 
  * Switch Yuna, summon Valefor, Boost once and cast Fire until you kill the mushroom.
  * Keep fighting encounters as the notes says until you reach Yuna's Sphere Level.

## Bikanel Island
  * Get this chest when you reach it.
  ![Bikanel Chest](https://i.imgur.com/trJVLUu.png)

  If you happen to come across a weapon like Mage Masher before Bikanel then I highly suggest you skip this. Getting this chest guarantees you 1-2 encounters that you have to run away from. This is very subjective but it saved me a couple of times where this chest saved me from being short of money by calm lands (Minimum Bribe is 35k per Flan and I would have gotten 65k if it weren't for this chest.) Also bribing amount is purely RNG so even if you got the minimum amount of money it doesn't guarantee you getting 24 Fire Gems from the Flans.
