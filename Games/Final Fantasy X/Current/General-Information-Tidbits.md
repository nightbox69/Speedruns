# General Knowledge

  * This is meant to be a catch all of general knowledge techniques that can be applied to most routes/run types.
  * Most of these are just for ease of life than prioritizing speed. 
  * Any techniques specific to a type of run will be stated.
  * This is made just a catch all of all the stupid things the owner of the repo does just incase he comes back and forget all of these again.

## Using Potions in the first part of the run

  * The idea of this is to use up all your potions after Klikk to make sure you only have one or two left until the Rikku Tutorial reasoning will be explained in the next section. 
    * To do this, simply use potions when menu-ing for option changes and then before the double Piranha fight in Tros.
  * Sometimes you'll be left with 4 or 5 potions depending on how lucky you've gotten. This is fine, simply use all the potions you have left after the Tidus Sphere Grid in extractor.

## Item placements

  * Potions being used up in the rikku tutorial is to free up the first slot of the item row for lightning marbles which is used extensively for the mid game.
  * If you use different languages and have a hard time distinguishing things for mixes later then use common sense, the last rows of items always have Bomb Core x2, then all the items you stole all in order of when you stole them.
    * To make things easier for you use Fish Scales as your anchor point then determine where your other steals are as they would always be before or after fish scales.
  * You can however manually set items before the bevelle guard fights for ease of access during rikku mixes later on. 
    * Manually exchanging Lightning Marbles (or Black Magic Spheres) or Silence Grenades x6 or Grenades x2 will make rikku mixes easier to find.
    * You can go all out if you want by putting elixir below the grenades for easier access during the evrae fight if you really are that anal about it. Elixirs used on Evrae Altana is around 1.5-3 seconds faster than Phoenix Downs.

## Selling Weapons

  * When Selling Weapons the idea is to sell the first weapon in the slot at Luca not for gil but for placement. 
    * Selling Longsword in Luca Oaka is to place Stunning Steel in the first row for easy changing in Chocobo Eater later.
    * Selling Stunning Steel (or Longsword) and Buckler is to place Sonic Steel and Shimmering Blade on first and second slot respectively. This is for easy access in Customize later in the game so you do not have to find them.

## Wendigo

  * There is a very small but not impossible chance of a Wendigo Double Tap on Tidus during the fight, this happens when the Guado casts a non-thunder element on Tidus then Wendigo hits him.
    * This is preventable by gridding the HP on the very top during the Seymour Tidus Grid section while doing the rest of the grid normally.
    * This is also totally preventable by doing [Oddmog Strats][1].

## Blitz Loss Evrae

  * This is just incase you forgot to do all the things blitz loss strats requires you to do during Thunder plains or you are lacking in Strength Spheres and have no plans on getting any extra for one reason or another.
    * $${\color{red}SAVE \space TIDUS \space OVERDRIVE \space UNTIL \space EVRAE, \space DO \space NOT \space FUCKING \space OVERDRIVE \space WENDIGO \space YOU \space FUCKING \space DUMBASS}$$
    * If for some reason you overdrive'd wendigo charge tidus overdrive on Bikanel but you're on your own on how. and yes you're required to have overdrive to survive.
    * Normal Blitz Win Strat on Evrae except you overdrive after Haste. 

# Any% Manip

## General Manip Planning (for No Reset Runs)

  * The order of business of manipulation is manipulating for Silence Grenades x6 first, then Manipulating for No Encounters then Manipulating 2 or No Return Sphere Drops with 1st Ghost No Encounters Armor all in that order.

## Silence Grenades x6
  * In cases where you have a surplus of Strength Spheres that you have no use of or are planning to get some in the later parts of the run. Check if Kimahri needs to not die in order for you to steal Silence Grenades x6 on Anima.
    * If he needs to not die then you can grid 2x HP Spheres on Kimahri which is just next to Rikku.
