# General Knowledge

  * This is meant to be a catch all of general knowledge techniques that can be applied to most routes/run types.
  * Most of these are just for ease of life than prioritizing speed. 
  * Any techniques specific to a type of run will be stated.
  * This is made just a catch all of all the stupid things the owner of the repo does just incase he comes back and forget all of these again.
  * Anything condescending that are written in these notes are meant for the main user of these notes which is the owner. Having said that, the owner has no responsibility to apologize to anyone who has been offended reading these notes. You have been warned.

## Using Potions in the first part of the run

  * The idea of this is to use up all your potions after Klikk to make sure you only have one or two left until the Rikku Tutorial reasoning will be explained in the next section. 
    * To do this, simply use potions when menu-ing for option changes and then before the double Piranha fight in Tros.
  * Sometimes you'll be left with 4 or 5 potions depending on how lucky you've gotten. This is fine, simply use all the potions you have left after the Tidus Sphere Grid in extractor.

## Item placements

  * Potions being used up in the rikku tutorial is to free up the first slot of the item row for lightning marbles which is used extensively for the mid game.
  * If you use different languages and have a hard time distinguishing things for mixes later then use common sense, the last rows of items always have Bomb Core x2, then all the items you stole all in order of when you stole them.
    * To make things easier for you use Fish Scales as your anchor point then determine where your other steals are as they would always be before or after fish scales.
  * You can however manually set items before the bevelle guard fights for ease of access during rikku mixes later on. 
    * Manually exchanging Lightning Marbles (or Black Magic Spheres) or Silence Grenades x6 or Grenades x2 will make rikku mixes easier to find.
    * You can go all out if you want by putting elixir below the grenades for easier access during the evrae fight if you really are that anal about it. Elixirs used on Evrae Altana is around 1.5-3 seconds faster than Phoenix Downs.

## Selling Weapons

  * When Selling Weapons the idea is to sell the first weapon in the slot at Luca not for gil but for placement. 
    * Selling Longsword in Luca Oaka is to place Stunning Steel in the first row for easy changing in Chocobo Eater later.
    * Selling Stunning Steel (or Longsword) and Buckler is to place Sonic Steel and Shimmering Blade on first and second slot respectively. This is for easy access in Customize later in the game so you do not have to find them.

## Killing Basilisks for Tidus Grid

  * Only do these if you get / are guaranteed a Lightning Steel whichever method you use depends on your circumstances.

  * Kimahri Method (Fastest Method)
    * Grid 1x HP Sphere on Kimahri
    * Lancet Bomb in MRR, Old Road or Mi'hen
    * Self-Destruct first basilisk, Flee after
    * Lancet first basilisk
    * After Extractor Grid - Tidus, Remove Kimahri from Party
    * Lancet next Basilisk

  * Valefor Method (Consider this only if you're short of Speed Spheres and is guaranteed a Basilisk - Double Bee, this is atleast 2.5minutes slower)
    * Save Sphere before Cloister
    * Charge Overdrive on your way out of Kilika
    * Grid Magic Sphere on Yuna
    * Party Order before Basilisk is Tidus, Yuna, Wakka
      * Switch for Kimahri - Lancet
      * Tidus Defend
      * Valefor Overdrive
      * Valefor Water - Surviving Enemies
    * After Extractor Grid - Tidus

## Wendigo

  * There is a very small but not impossible chance of a Wendigo Double Tap on Tidus during the fight, this happens when the Guado casts a non-thunder element on Tidus then Wendigo hits him.
    * This is preventable by gridding the HP on the very top during the Seymour Tidus Grid section while doing the rest of the grid normally. (Terrible Idea)
    * This is also totally preventable by doing [Oddmog Strats][1].

## Blitz Loss Evrae

  * This is just incase you forgot to do all the things blitz loss strats requires you to do during Thunder Plains or you are lacking in Strength Spheres for one reason or another.
    * $${\color{red}SAVE \space TIDUS \space OVERDRIVE \space UNTIL \space EVRAE, \space DO \space NOT \space FUCKING \space OVERDRIVE \space WENDIGO \space YOU \space FUCKING \space DUMBASS}$$
    * If for some reason you overdrive'd wendigo charge tidus overdrive on Bikanel but you're on your own on how. and yes you're required to have overdrive to survive.
    * Grid Tidus for 1700HP
    * Grid Kimahri needs 1800HP
    * Normal Blitz Win Strat on Evrae then you overdrive after Evrae Poison Breath. 

# Any% Manip

## General Manip Planning (for No Reset Runs)

  * The order of business of manipulation is manipulating for Silence Grenades x6 first, then Manipulating for No Encounters then Manipulating 2 or No Return Sphere Drops with 1st Ghost No Encounters Armor all in that order.

## Mushroom Rock Road Encounters

  * If for some reason you would prefer to have less encounters in MRR consider doing the slower version of MRR skip. 
    * Instead of head to the save sphere area head straight to the chocobo while the cutscene is playing and stop immediately when you hit the wall. 
      * Allow the man to pass through first before doing your setup. Setting up before the man passes through will enable him to push you out of the way adding to your already terrible step count.
    * Only do this if you're trying to avoid a 6th (not guaranteed) or 7th encounter.

## Silence Grenades x6
  * In cases where you have a surplus of Power Spheres that you have no use of or are planning to get some in the later parts of the run. Check if Kimahri needs to not die during Extractor in order for you to steal Silence Grenades x6 on Anima.
    * If he needs to not die then you can grid 2x HP Spheres on Kimahri which is just next to Rikku, then Heal Kimahri to full.
    * Kimahri should survive at 1044 hp during extractor. Switch Kimahri with Yuna and defend with Lulu reviving Rikku. Then Switch Yuna with Tidus and Change Weapon to Brotherhood.

## Home Fights
  * In cases where you're kinda locked for NEA and you have pre-emptive Dual Horn and / or Chimera Fights kill the Guado with Tidus then Stone Breath.
    * Switch Tidus with Kimahri and then Lancet
    * Switch the 2nd character with Tidus then attack the guado
    * Kimahri Stone Breath
  * ALWAYS CHECK FOR POSSIBLE COMBINATIONS DURING THE KIMAHRI STONE BREATH FIGHTS AS THERE CAN BE TWO SAME NAME DROPS WITH DIFFERENT STATS THAT CAN MAKE OR BREAK YOUR NO ENCOUNTERS.
