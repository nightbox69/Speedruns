## Strategy Concept

He's red in the first stage, so a Magnify and IceBlast should take him down,
then we he switches he becomes black. Do some damage with Serge, then Turn the
field blue for a FrogPrince, followed up by a Luminaire. If you are lucky he'll
be dead, if not cast another spell from Leena.
