# Momma Komodo

## Optimizations

### Fight

This fight doesn't have anything tricky to it, and doesn't seem to have any more
optimizations that can be made. If you could somehow manipulate RNG I guess you
could 3/3/Fireball here, but that's about it from what I can tell.

### Split

So I looked into the Silver Loupe, and the math just doesn't work out for
picking it up. Costs a little too much that needs to be recovered in 21 fights.

## Strategy Concept

Use the 2/2 here to just try and ensure damage. If you were feeling frisky you
could probably do 3s here to shave like a half to full second maybe, but not
sure that is worth it. Seems like you are just as likely to lose time. In an RNG
grindfest like this probably best just to be consistent.

## Scripted Fight

  * **Momma Komodo (76)**
    * 2/2/2/Fireball (49 or above HP fireball for single pass). 2/2 your way to
      victory if any issues.
