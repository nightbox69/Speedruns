# Guards

## Optimizations

Possibly look into whether or not something like a magma bomb via Kid could
improve the speed here? Also takes out the semi-randomness of attack misses.

## Strategy Concept

We have the Steel Swallow and Iron Dagger here, so we are doing pretty good
damage via attacks. Utilize that and skip any spell animations. As pretty much
always, take out the weaker enemies first to reduce their animations.
