## Strategy Concept

Plan here is to magnify and kill him with FrogPrince. Turn red to start, then
follow up with WeakMinded and Magnify, then hammer him with blue elements. Have
to be careful about double bodyslam killing either Leena or Glenn here, in which
case you need to run away.

## Scripted Fight

  * **Taurusoid (1260/11)**
    * Leena - 1/2/2 (Get to Level 5)/TurnRed
    * Glenn - 2/3 (Get to Level 5)
    * Serge - 1/1/WeakMinded
    * Leena - 1/1 until Level 5
    * Glenn - Magnify
    * Leena - Aquaball
    * Glenn - Aquaball (TurnBlue if Leena 15-17 Magic)
    * Serge - Aquaball
    * Leena - 1/1 until Level 5/FrogPrince
