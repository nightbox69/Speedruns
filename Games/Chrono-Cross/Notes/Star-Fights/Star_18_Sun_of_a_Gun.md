## Strategy Concept

Turn the field blue and use FrogPrince. His HP is so low, that really all you
need to do is be able to cast it and you should kill him. Be careful of Kissy
Wissy here. It will freeze the person hit (most likely), and you will need to
panacea them. His next phase after that should be a physical attack however, so
as long as you got setup before the attack you should be fine.
