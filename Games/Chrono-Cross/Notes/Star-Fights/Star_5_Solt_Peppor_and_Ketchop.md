# Solt, Peppor and Ketchop

## Optimizations

None that I can tell off hand. Single target, and we hit as hard as the elements
in most cases, plus we don't want to overpopulate the red on the field. Seems
like this is about as good as it can be without RNG of the gods.

## Strategy Concept

We will only attack Ketchop here since he will take out Solt and Peppor for us.
Pierre should be the first in the party so he takes the massive damage hit to
start the fight. Pray to RNJesus that the smash attack hits Serge who is still
at full health so you can get everyone their stat upgrade.
