# Karsh, Solt and Peppor

### Split

One thing to look into is the mini stat up after 2 fights in this split. If you
get a strength up here, then it is probably worth the extra fight that occurs,
but it is a risk. Also it's probably worth it in a full play through, and not
something like cat% or a race. Actually probably is worth it in a marathon for
a chance at an extra strength up for not that much time loss.

## Strategy Concept

Take out the weakest enemies first to save animations, then focus on Karsh. No
real danger of death here as far as I can tell.
