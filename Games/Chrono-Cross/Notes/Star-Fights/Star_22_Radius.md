## Strategy Concept

Get Sprigg to turn into Lagoonate and then hit him as hard as possible. Radius
has higher evade than normal, so your %s will 10% lower than normal.

## Scripted Fight

  * **Radius (787/7)**
    * Sprig - 1/1/... until Lagoonate
    * Lynx - 2/3
    * Lagoon - 2/3
    * Lynx - 2/2/2
