## Giant Gloop

**Note:** The Fights from here on out are going to get trickier, some will just need you to attack but most will prioritize on Element Spams. The notes will also adjust to this as well, advising you to get to a certain level instead of picking your attacks. Pick your attacks in priority to getting the levels as safe and as assuredly as possible instead of fast. It's highly adviseable to start counting Enemy AP here too so you'll know when the next attack will be. It'll return to attack picking should it be needed.
