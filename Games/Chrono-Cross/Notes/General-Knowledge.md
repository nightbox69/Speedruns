# General Knowledge

This is meant to be a catch all of general knowledge techniques that can be
applied to most any route/run type.

## Avoiding Fights

Always do this at all costs unless specified!!!! Even if you have to take an
extra few seconds to avoid a fight, it costs about 20 to run away.

## Switching Characters

Do this to rotate who you would like to attack first in a fight.

## How Stamina Works

Stolen Directly from EvilAsh who knows this game better than I ever will.

  * **Stamina Pushing or Attack Queueing**
    * When attacking in this game, you can queue attacks up to whatever stamina
      you have left to spend. 
    * If the enemy is due to attack after the next stamina point is spent (see
      the next Enemy AP section) the game will allow you to queue (and execute)
      up to 2 attacks before the enemy does his attack. It doesn’t matter if the
      attack is 1/1, 2/2, 3/3, 2/3, 1/2, or whatever.  Most common is 3/3 of
      course, to either get in max damage, or refresh stamina for another
      character.  I sometimes refer to this as ‘mashing’ an attack.
    * In some cases NOT Stamina Pushing is important, this happens on bosses
      that change phases mid-fight, most notably the Dragon God. If you Stamina
      Push the Dragon God, say a 3/3 and it does enough damage to send him to
      the next phase, it will not until you do another attack, and usually this
      will let the Dragon God get an attack in. This is why you sometimes see a
      ‘miss’ that sends her to the next phase.  To prevent queueing, you have to
      wait for the bar on the left side to turn from Red to White before
      executing the next attack.
  * **Enemy AP (Action Points)**
    * This is an extremely important element to the game, AP is the amount of
      stamina that you can spend before each enemy takes its turn. I’ve listed
      this for every fight, and it is important to keep track of spent stamina
      for each turn.  Knowing how to use this will make the difference between
      getting off a FrogPrince in time, to killing Garai without healing and him
      destroying you.
    * As far as AP goes, each attack costs 1, 2, or 3 AP, and an Element cast or
      Defend costs 1 AP.
    * You can also get more AP from enemies than the listed minimum. The AP that
      I list for each enemy is the minimum stamina that they will have each
      turn, however I found that there is a random element to it. For example
      Marcy has 7 AP, but I’ve found that for a given turn she can have between
      7-10 AP, and she is just as likely to have 10AP as 7AP for a given turn.
      This variation can be both good and bad. It is good in cases where you are
      very tight on stamina and have to cast a FrogPrince. It can be bad when
      you are trying to go for a Stamina Refresh (see next section) and the
      extra enemy AP causes only a partial refresh.
    * Basic strategy here is to spend stamina up to where the enemy is going to
      attack next turn, then Stamina Push a 3/3 to maximize your stamina use
      before the enemy gets a turn.
    * Starting Enemy AP - While you still get the first turn, and can Stamina
      Push, it is completely random, and it can be a value between 1 to the max
      AP (AP+random amount). It can cause huge time losses if you don’t know how
      to handle bad starting stamina in some fights.
  * **Stamina Refreshing**
    * The basics to getting a full stamina refresh is having all your (alive)
      characters either in negative stamina, or defending when the enemy takes
      his turn. It is not fully understood yet, but as far as I can tell, what
      happens is the enemy takes a turn, then the game tries to find the next
      character with positive stamina to take a turn. If no character is
      positive, it then gives free stamina out to everyone, with the enemy only
      taking one turn during this period. Doing this is not 100% consistent as
      the enemy’s AP value (which is random) can affect it, but you are more
      likely to get a stamina refresh the more negative your stamina is, as well
      as how close to you are to the enemy's next turn.
    * This is most heavily used in the Dario fight, with death abuse, and
      automatic Dario counters, 3 total stamina refreshes are used.

## Stat Ups

After each star your characters have the ability to receive a stat upgrade.
While these are random, the game itself is shooting for an average value for
different stats on each character. That doesn't mean you will hit them of
course, but if you miss multiple strength ups for instance, you should have a
higher likelihood of getting strength ups later. Note that a character that is
knocked out at the end of a battle will not receive stat upgrades.
