# General Knowledge

This is meant to be a catch all of general knowledge techniques that can be applied to most any route/run type.

## Avoiding Fights

Always do this at all costs unless specified!!!! Even if you have to take an
extra few seconds to avoid a fight, as it costs about 20seconds to run away.

## Switching Characters

Press Select to switch Characters. Do this to rotate who you would like to attack first in a fight.

## How Stamina Works

Stolen Directly from EvilAsh who knows this game better than I ever will.

  * **Stamina Pushing or Attack Queueing**
    * When attacking in this game, you can queue attacks up to whatever stamina you have left to spend. 
    * If the enemy is due to attack after the next stamina point is spent (see the next Enemy AP section) the game will allow you to queue (and execute) up to 2 attacks before the enemy does his attack. It doesn’t matter if the attack is 1/1, 2/2, 3/3, 2/3, 1/2, or whatever. Most common is 3/3 of course, to either get in max damage, or refresh stamina for another character. I sometimes refer to this as ‘mashing’ an attack.
    * In some cases NOT Stamina Pushing is important, this happens on bosses that change phases mid-fight, most notably the Dragon God. If you Stamina Push the Dragon God, say a 3/3 and it does enough damage to send him to the next phase, it will not until you do another attack, and usually this will let the Dragon God get an attack in. This is why you sometimes see a miss that sends her to the next phase. To prevent queueing, you have to wait for the bar on the left side to turn from Red to White before executing the next attack.
  * **Enemy AP (Action Points)**
    * This is an extremely important element to the game, AP is the amount of stamina that you can spend before each enemy takes its turn. I’ve listed this for every fight, and it is important to keep track of spent stamina for each turn. Knowing how to use this will make the difference between getting off a FrogPrince in time, to killing Garai without healing and him destroying you.
    * As far as AP goes, each attack costs 1 or 2 or 3 AP, and an Element cast or Defend costs 1 AP.
    * You can also get more AP from enemies than the listed minimum. The AP that I list for each enemy is the minimum stamina that they will have each turn, however I found that there is a random element to it. For example Marcy has 7 AP, but I’ve found that for a given turn she can have between 7-10 AP, and she is just as likely to have 10AP as 7AP for a given turn. This variation can be both good and bad. It is good in cases where you are very tight on stamina and have to cast a FrogPrince. It can be bad when you are trying to go for a Stamina Refresh (see next section) and the extra enemy AP causes only a partial refresh.
    * Basic strategy here is to spend stamina up to where the enemy is going to attack next turn, then Stamina Push a 3/3 to maximize your stamina use before the enemy gets a turn.
    * Starting Enemy AP - While you still get the first turn, and can Stamina Push, it is completely random, and it can be a value between 1 to the max AP (AP+random amount). It can cause huge time losses if you don’t know how to handle bad starting stamina in some fights.
  * **Stamina Refreshing**
    * The basics to getting a full stamina refresh is having all your (alive) characters either in negative stamina, or defending when the enemy takes his turn. It is not fully understood yet, but as far as I can tell, what happens is the enemy takes a turn, then the game tries to find the next character with positive stamina to take a turn. If no character is positive, it then gives free stamina out to everyone, with the enemy only taking one turn during this period. Doing this is not 100% consistent as the enemy’s AP value (which is random) can affect it, but you are more likely to get a stamina refresh the more negative your stamina is, as well as how close to you are to the enemy's next turn.
    * This is most heavily used in the Dario fight, with death abuse, and automatic Dario counters, 3 total stamina refreshes are used.
  * **Other Misc Tips**
    * You can just hold the X button to enter most areas from the world map. This doesn’t work for landing or entering the boat. 
    * Doors, the true boss of this game.  To open doors quickly what I do is hold the walk button while mashing the open button. So either hold L1, mash X or Hold Circle, mash R1. This seems to make doors much more manageable.  Practice these in the Ghost Ship. 
    * In the first battle, press Triangle while selecting a target to change the camera to ‘dynamic’ mode.  When in dynamic mode, the button inputs for selecting targets are 100% consistent and the same every time.  In normal mode, the direction that you have to press will depend on the camera angle, which can be different between battles. 
    * In battle, if a character is attacking and is interrupted by an enemy attacking another character, and you are planning on casting an element next, you can hold the Circle button and then cast the element.  This prevents the full jumping forward (and then back) animation the character does to attack again. 
    * In battles with text, you can just hold the Circle button to auto-advance through the text. It is a little weird how it works, but if you hold the button before the dialog box pops up it usually works fine.
    * Buffs like Strengthen and EagleEye automatically target the lead character, so use this to your advantage to cast elements quickly.  
    * Also when casting Elements the cursor will always start at a specific location, this is why we equip Elements like Strengthen and EagleEye in specific locations. 
  * **Battles that a new player should focus on:**
    * Dario
      * Counting stamina is very important for this fight. This is so you know how much AP you have to work with before forcing Dario to counter-attack. 
      * Getting the first Stamina refresh is required for this strat. If the 2nd refresh doesn’t happen, you should be able to recover from it by either defending with Lynx over and over to regen Marcy Stamina, or defending + use Revive on Marcy if Dario targets her. 
    * Miguel
      * You learn to count your damage and general adhoc skills due to the somewhat complex nature of the fight.
    * Garai
      * You learn more adhoc skills while counting stamina.
    * Dragon God
      * This fight is not especially too difficult. But Damage counting and Stamina Pushing Phases are things you can get used to here.
    * Taurusoid
      * If you fuck this fight up then you're not counting AP properly.
    * Bunyip
      * This fight is practically your midterm exam about what you learned doing in Fort Dragonia.
  * Ghost Ship Key
    * One of 3 people will have this key, you can check the notes to see where they are specifically. 
    * To make sure that one of them has the key you MUST NOT walk away when talking to the pirate after the ‘ghost dance’.  You must clear his last textbox before you walk away from him.  If you didn’t trigger this properly, this guy will have the key AFTER you check the other 3. 

## Stat Ups

After each star your characters have the ability to receive a stat upgrade. While these are random, the game itself is shooting for an average value for different stats on each character. That doesn't mean you will hit them of course, but if you miss multiple strength ups for instance, you should have a higher likelihood of getting strength ups later. Note that a character that is knocked out at the end of a battle will not receive stat upgrades.
