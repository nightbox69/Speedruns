# Final Fantasy X Nemesis% Speedrun Guide

* Currently on Draft phase.
* Notes came from <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/maffoonian">Maffoonian</a>.

## General Information

  * Run ends after killing Yu Yevon after you killed Nemesis.
  * PC HD Remaster - You can use the Any% Auto Splitter for this run. Just remember to manually split on the splits that are not included on the Any% List.
  * Any% means that you will follow strategies stated on the <a href="https://goo.gl/nFdPyN">Any% Notes</a> by <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/flobberworm4">Flobberworm4</a> while following these other rules (Don't forget to split on the bosses).
    * **Never** pick up HP Nodes on Tidus. Leave him at **520 Health**.
    * Pick up all **Accuracy Nodes** scattered in the way of Tidus's Any% Sphere Grid Menu.
  * Use Tidus to Capture most of the Monsters. The Kill Count stacks to the Karma and will increase damage dealt to Tidus.
  * Quick Hit nerfed to Tier 2 from Tier 1 + more mana from the Original version on the International and HD Remaster versions. 
  * Use Tidus to capture all Fiends before Omega Ruins. The Kill Count stacks to Karma and will increase damage dealt to Tidus improving efficiency of the grind.

## Sinspawn Ammes - Guadosalam

  * Any%, but do not **activate the HP nodes** on Tidus.

 **Note:** Tidus can be in critical HP faster than usual on extractor. So remember to Super Potion him with Wakka after two Aqua Shooters hit Tidus.

## Thunder Plains

  * Activate the First Qactuar Stone northwest from the Save Sphere (Press Square on the Stone).
  * Charge Yuna / Rikku / Tidus Overdrive on the Iron Giant (Doesn't have to be done in one encounter, can also charge Overdrive in Macalania Chimeras).

  	* Iron Giant - Light Curtain (Optional: Steal a 2nd one on another encounter)

**Note:** Don't waste your time activating the other Qactuars Stones at this time. You can activate the other stones during the Capture Session.
